RCV Presentation Text

Slide 1: Title Slide

Slide 2: Logistics of ranked choice voting & how it works 
-The guidelines for RCV are set by the Board of Elections for each municipality's election. 
-For San Francisco's Board of Supervisor's November 2016 election, voters selected and ranked their top three candidates. If the voter's first choice is eliminated, their vote then becomes  transfered to their second choice, and so forth. 
Slide 3: Sample Ballot Images

-Each ballot line is a unique voter and rank (three lines form a full ballot entry for the Board of Supervisor of their district)

Slide 4: Ballot Master Look Up File
-This file was used as a key in order to decipher the ballot lines.

Slide 5: Tidied Data Set 
-The entries for the tided data set.
-Each line of the table contains a unique voter and the election they voted in, their precinct, and three ranked candidates.

Side 6: Totalling the votes
-[Code explaination here]
-For each round, the candidate with the least votes was eliminated and had their votes transferred until there was only one candidate left. 

Slide 7: "Snakey" Visualization
-An interactive visualization that traces the transferring of votes through the rounds for each candidate.

Slide 8: Under and Over Voting
-The proportion of under and over voting for each candidate in each district. 
-District 3 had an unexpected amount of undervoting, possibly becuase only one candidate was running. 

Slide 9: Under and Over Voting Adjusted
-Slide 8 visualization was adjusted with the removal of outlying districts and regression lines were drawn.
